CleaningDataProject
===================
##Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Steps
1. Download run_analysis.r and place in the '''UCI HAR Dataset''' folder.
2. Set pwd
3. Run '''source("run_analysis.r")''', this will create the tiny_data.txt file.
4. This file has all of the above steps included.
